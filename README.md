# Introduction

We have chosen the social sciences domain, and our goal is to discover which are the variables that affect the wellness of a country. For this purpose the measurement of “wellness” that we are going to use is the happiness score per country. We know that is very hard to try to find these results but we are looking for insights that help to the world leaders to take better decisions.

A good aspect of social sciences are the amount of available resources that can be found on internet that would improve our analysis. So with this we could take data from different sources and get data from very different angles like as the GDP per country or the military expenses per country.

## selected domain

social sciences: world happiness

## Third project

The third project that we found is [Who takes the loan?](https://www.kaggle.com/niyamatalmass/who-takes-the-loan) that is using the dataset  [Country Statistics - UNData](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/undata-country-profiles/kernels). This project is interesting because shows which are the the sectors of economy that are earning more money in relation with the others and at the same time is doing an analysis of several variables in countries like as unemployement rate. one of the parts that we enjoyed the most was the ranking of which countries need more help, so these were some of the reasons for taking this project as one the related ones.
