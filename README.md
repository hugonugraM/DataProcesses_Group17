# Introduction

We have chosen the social sciences domain, and our goal is to discover which are the variables that affect the wellness of a country. For this purpose the measurement of “wellness” that we are going to use is the happiness score per country. We know that is very hard to try to find these results but we are looking for insights that help to the world leaders to take better decisions.

A good aspect of social sciences are the amount of available resources that can be found on internet that would improve our analysis. So with this we could take data from different sources and get data from very different angles like as the GDP per country or the military expenses per country.

## selected domain

social sciences: world happiness

# Domain related projects

## First project

The first project is about [wold happiness](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness/). This [project](https://www.kaggle.com/vamsikrishna/happiness-index-and-terrorism/) investigate the relationship between index of happiness and terrorism, by combining two different datasets : one related to world happiness and the other is related to terrorist attacks worldwide between 1970-2016.

## Second project

Another project related with the countries wellness measure is about Suicide Rates from the year 1985 to 2016. This dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016) and the project that aims to compare socio-economic info with the given suicide rates is given [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lmorgan95/r-suicide-rates-in-depth-stats-insights/data). In the project, using several different charts like faceted bar, faceted line and faceted scatter plots; several results are found such as the suicide rates are decreasing globally as the year increases and the suicide rates generally increase with the age.

## Third project

The third project that we found is [Who takes the loan?](https://www.kaggle.com/niyamatalmass/who-takes-the-loan) that is using the dataset  [Country Statistics - UNData](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/undata-country-profiles/kernels). This project is interesting because shows which are the the sectors of economy that are earning more money in relation with the others and at the same time is doing an analysis of several variables in countries like as unemployement rate. one of the parts that we enjoyed the most was the ranking of which countries need more help, so these were some of the reasons for taking this project as one the related ones.

# Questions


+ Does exist a correlation between the life expectancy and the happiness of a country?

# Datasets

3 datasets given above can be described as follows:

## 1st Dataset 

.

## 2nd Dataset

*Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016* Link:https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016

This dataset is created from four other datasets linked by time and place, and was built to find possible correlations among suicide rates and different cohorts across the socio-economic spectrum. The dataset is constructed using *World Bank Dataset* and its terms of use (license) comprises of *Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0)*, under which the use of the data is permitted given that the source of data should also be provided.

The dataset contains 27820 observations of 12 different features and some of these features are *age*, *population*, *country*, *gdp* and *generation*. Thus, some of the **questions** to ask about this dataset might be **"Which generation belonging to which country is more likely to commit suicide?"** or **Is there any relation between a country's economic strength(gdp) and its citizens likelihood of committing suicide?**.
